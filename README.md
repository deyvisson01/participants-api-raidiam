# participants-api-raidiam

Hello guys! This small project is based on the challenge proposed by Raidiam for the position of senior front-end developer.

It was my first contact with Vue in a long time, so it took me a while to adapt and solve the problems that arose from installing some dependencies that were changed for Vue 3.

I used Vue 2 because it is what they use in the company.

At the end of the challenge I was left with some doubts about what information should be displayed, since the endpoint provided seems to be just an array of simple items, so if any important data is left out, I apologize.

And that's it! Thank you very much for the opportunity and time to evaluate my work.

Best!
